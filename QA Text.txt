This was my first time using Pygame to build a game so I was enjoying learning things as I was building the game.
I am proficient at Unity and Godot and I was able to transfer my skills of gamedev to this project easily.

Although an interesting bug appeared at the end of development.
Whenever I would run the game, another game would appear where you would have to click the screen to collect balls.
I was confused how would this even happen, as it was such a bizzare thing to happen.
I looked through my code from start to finish but after debugging figured out that it was happening even before one line of my code had run.
After almost an hour, I figured it out.
It turned out that I had accidentally imported an example game from the Pygame library, and I guess it runs on its own once imported.
The mistake happened because one of my variables had the same name as the example game and my editor added the import by itself at one point.
The fix was easy, just removing the unnecessary import.

For testing, I would make sure that the algorithm for determining average height of the islands was functional by testing a few edge cases.
Also, it would be pretty important that there is a clear destinction between different heights which are represented by different colors.
Lastly, making sure the clicks on the islands work correctly.

Additional features I would add would be:
- Procedural map generator and bigger maps, it would add a lot more replayability 
- Many gamemodes, always fun
- Cleaner user interface, it would be easier to do it in Unity for example, than Pygame

I think I would remove lives entirely, and just replace them with losing score. 
I see this as a relaxing guessing game, and the concept of lives adds unnecessary stress, even if its little.
